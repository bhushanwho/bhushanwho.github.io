# there was this quote i came across

###### i swear these always start with corny shit like this

> maybe your garden isn't growing because every time a flower blooms, you cut it to prove to someone else that you're a gardener

call this retrospection, call this shouting a truth being in the midst of a performative crowd, call it being fed up on reading dogshit AI slop content and code all day, call it whatever.

this is, the what, 7th "ramble"?

it's been three quarters of a year since this has been up, yet not one sound blog other than these.

fits nicely into the topic, tbh. blog writing. "technical blog" writing

a lot of blog writing seems performative.

writing for a crowd. well i mean, sure, i guess that's what blogs are for. but again, it feels silly.

feels like growing a flower and then plucking it off, to show it off. for, validation?

or maybe it's the sense that i haven't really outlined who i'm writing these for, because i write these for me. and to me, i'd rather have heartfelt ramblings than some technical breakdown on _lax_ or _SameSiteCookies_.

or a mix of both. i'm quick to abandon the idea beacuse i deem it corny. or i just haven't "savant"-ed enough headfirst into something to WANT to write about it.

somehow revolves around the same motto i always had. "do things that inspire."

although, really, i believe it's always been a "run away from things that do not inspire", it's contrapositive.

wait no.

$p \to q$
$\newline \neg p \to \neg q$

inverse, not the contrapositive.

anyhow, i also got thinking of my

## [very first ramble](https://bhushanwho.github.io/ramblings/darksouls/)

i cringe a bit everytime i remember it. and then some more when i go back and read it.

i always feel like taking it down along with most of what little i have on here. but i mean, who's reading these anyway. if anything they provide a nice relative context for much change has occurred.

yeah, they say to "cringe" at your past-self is a nice indicator for how much you've changed. although that's giving myself too much credit lmfao.

anyway, in that ramble,

i talked of how "art", was this thing i always wanted to be good at, but never was, and disliked the fact that i never got into.

and made an entire dissertation on how i "felt" of those two books.

that's stupid, i've come to realize.

just like the initial quote. it's the same thing. the flowers i grew were the first few pages of those books i've read, and the appreciation for art.

never "gardened" them. just plucked them off to be on display for a silly ramble on this silly site, for a silly fellow.

so yeah. now that i realize that, and the quote's a nice one to put into practice, here i am.

started sketching, it's been a month.

i've also completed the books. they're alright.

i guess reading them with a saner/busier mind as opposed to an anxious 19 year old jobless-over-the-summer mind does change perspectives, but there you go that's, that.

and yeah like that ending: maybe gardening, hands in the soil, maybe doing things without a point, is, in fact, the point.

fuck you, i guess, dark souls adorning bhushan.
