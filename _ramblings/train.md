# silly

'the lunchbox' had a nice quote.

> kabhi kabhi galat train bhi sahi station par pahuncha deti hai

it is an INSANELY good movie, i thoroughly love every bit of it.

the quote, beautiful, but not very practically ideal. infact there's a japanese proverb that goes against the very nature of the quote. something like "if you get on the wrong train, get off at the next station. the longer you stay, the more expensive your return ticket gets."

# anyhow

just earlier, my laptop's charger wouldn't fit. something was stuck in the charging port.

went to grab a pair of tweezers from a cluttered pencil-stand. at immediate glance, found a thin bottom-up incense stick instead. my laziness assumed it'd do the trick, and i pulled it out only to find the tweezers attached to the head of it. immediately remembered that train quote and got to jotting this up. chose the incense stick only for it to lead me to the tweezers.

it's been a while anyway, since anything ramble-worthy happened. took this as a perfect opportunity to yap, because who wouldn't.

# happy new year!
