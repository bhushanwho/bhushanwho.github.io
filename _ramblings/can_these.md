a loose ramble, just over this gorgeously pretty quote.

East of Eden - John Steinbeck

*“and now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good.”*

that one episode from The Office, where Pan voluntarily gets a customer complaint onto herself, just to get another card to complete a whole card arrangement monument-set; her choice of ending the perfect streak.

Technoblade, ending his bedwars streak on his own accord, jumping off a cliff.

to finally come to terms that you may not want, to be that perfect person that you’ve built in your head.

*“and now that you don’t have to be perfect, you can be good.”*
